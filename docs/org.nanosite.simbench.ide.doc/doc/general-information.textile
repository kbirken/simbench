h1. General Information

SIMBENCH is a modeling and simulation tool environment. Systems consisting of software blocks and hardware resources can be modeled. As there is a strong focus on modeling of dynamic behaviour, the models can be executed using simulation tools. The models can contain arbitrary variants expressed and configured by a feature model.

Should you find any problems or have a suggestion how we could improve SIMBENCH, please file an issue in the github issue tracker for the SIMBENCH project.

Currently there is no public continuous integration server.

h2. Where do I get it?

At the moment there is no binary distribution. You have to clone the source repository from github and build the plug-ins using an Eclipse development environment.
